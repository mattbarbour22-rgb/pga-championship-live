## API fix included

This version changes the Slash Golf call to:

/leaderboard?orgId=1&tournId=033&year=2026

Required Vercel variables:

SLASH_GOLF_API_KEY
SLASH_GOLF_API_HOST = live-golf-data.p.rapidapi.com
SLASH_GOLF_TOURN_ID = 033
SLASH_GOLF_YEAR = 2026
SLASH_GOLF_ORG_ID = 1


## RapidAPI clean endpoint version

This package only calls the working RapidAPI endpoint shown in your dashboard:

GET /leaderboards?orgId=1&tournId=033&year=2026

It removes the wrong singular /leaderboard endpoint to avoid wasting calls.

If /api/leaderboard returns status 429, the RapidAPI limit has been hit or temporarily rate-limited.
